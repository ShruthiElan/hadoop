1.characteristics of big data
volume,variety,veracity,velocity,value
2.solutions to big data
scaling out, scaling up
3. scaling up
increase the configuration of a single system like increasing the no of cores, RAM perfomance,
 data transfer speed but it is complex,costly and time consuming
scaling out
distributing load among multiple machines and it is less economical to use.
instead of using a single system with large storage we can use muliple systems..
